The plugin will allow a teacher to set up a list of groups, within which the student can exchange (for example, for course appointment times or rooms). The students will then be able to choose what group they want to switch away from, and which groups they would like to enter instead; they will get a list of other students' offers matching their wishes, or if there are none, will be prompted to save their exchange wish as an offer other students will be able to see and accept.

The plugin is very much a work-in-progress; no responsibility will be held for broken groups, Moodle installations, servers, data centers, or global warming.
